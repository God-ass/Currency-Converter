# Currency-Converter
This project is a comprehensive currency converter built in Excel using VBA. It uses real-time exchange rates to convert currency from one unit to another. The converter is designed with a user-friendly form that automates data queries and links the results for easy use.

## Features
- Real-time Exchange Rates: The converter uses real-time exchange rates for currency conversion.
- Historical Data: Users can enter any historical date to obtain the exchange rates/converted values for times in the past.
- Data Visualization: The converter generates a plot of exchange rates over the past 30 days.
- User Form: The converter is built with an easy-to-use VBA user form.

## Functionality
- Default Date: By default, the date shown is the current date.
- Currency Conversion: The converter can successfully make a variety of different exchanges and display the result in a message box.
- Date Functionality: The converter works on different dates.
- Quit Button: The quit button works perfectly. When the form is re-opened, it checks to make sure that the combo boxes do not have repeat values.
- Input Validation: The converter validates user input and displays an error message for invalid inputs.

## Screenshots
Due to variations in date formatting across the world, screenshots of the project working properly are included in the workbook.
